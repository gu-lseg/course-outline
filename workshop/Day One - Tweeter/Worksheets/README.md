## Morning Tasks - Learning the fundamentals

### Task 1

Define a function using the def keyword

```
def hello():

That function should return a string:

def hello():
    return "hello"
```

### Task 2

Define a variable called url which is assigned a string

```
url = "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/search/tweets.json"
```

### Task 3

Define a variable that concatenates a string and a variable

```
myName = url + "?test"
```

### Task 4

Define a variable which is assigned the boolean value of true

showTweets = true
```

### Task 5

Using our previously defined boolean value, write an if statements that shows or does not show depending on the boolean

if (showTweets) {
	print("Tweets are showing")
}
